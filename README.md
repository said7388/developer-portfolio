## <br />

# Getting Started :dart:

### Fork and Clone the repo

To Fork the repo click on the fork button at the top right of the page. Once the repo is forked open your terminal and perform the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/developer-portfolio.git

cd developer-portfolio
```

### Install packages from the root directory

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Usage :joystick:

Please create a new `.env` file from `.env.example` file.

Eg:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM =
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL =
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN =
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID =
GMAIL_PASSKEY =
EMAIL_ADDRESS =
```

### Then, Customize data in the `utils/data` [folder](https://github.com/said7388/developer-portfolio/tree/main/utils/data).

Eg:

```javascript
export const personalData = {
  name: "ABU SAID",
  profile: "/profile.png",
  designation: "Full-Stack Software Developer",
  description: "My name is ABU SAID....",
  email: "abusaid7388@gmail.com",
  phone: "+8801608797655",
  address: "Dhaka, Bangladesh",
  github: "https://github.com/said7388",
  facebook: "https://www.facebook.com/abusaid.riyaz/",
  linkedIn: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/abu-said-bd/",
  twitter: "https://twitter.com/said7388",
  stackOverflow: "https://stackoverflow.com/users/16840768/abu-said",
  leetcode: "https://leetcode.com/said3812/",
  devUsername: "said7388",
  resume: "...",
};
```

`devUsername` is used for fetching blog posts from `dev.to`.

# Deployment :rocket:

Deploying the app to platforms like Vercel or Netlify is quick and easy.

## Deploying to Vercel:

2. Once logged in, click on **"New Project"**.
3. Select your **GitHub repo** (the one that contains your forked project) and click **Import**.
4. Configure your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard by adding each key from your `.env` file.
   - E.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, etc.
5. Click on **Deploy**. Vercel will automatically detect your Next.js app and build it.
6. Once the deployment is complete, you can visit your live website!

### Updating After Deployment

Whenever you push changes to your GitHub repo, Vercel will automatically redeploy the app, keeping your portfolio up-to-date.

## Deploying to Netlify:

1. **Sign up or log in** to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2. In the **Netlify Dashboard**, click **"New site from Git"**.
3. Connect your **GitHub** account and select your repo.

# Tutorials :wrench:

## Gmail App Password Setup

1. **Log in to your Google Account** at [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **Security** from the left sidebar.
3. Scroll down to the **"Signing in to Google"** section and make sure **2-Step Verification** is turned ON.
4. Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, you'll see an option for **App Passwords**.
5. Click on **App Passwords**. You may need to enter your Google account password again.
6. In the **Select app** dropdown, choose "Mail", and for **Select device**, choose "Other (Custom name)" and name it appropriately (e.g., "Portfolio").
7. Click **Generate**. A 16-character app password will be displayed. Save this password for later use in your environment variables (e.g., `GMAIL_PASSKEY`).

## Create a Telegram Bot

1. **Open Telegram** and search for the user **@BotFather**.
2. Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
3. Choose a name for your bot.
4. Set a unique username for your bot (must end with `bot`, e.g., `PortfolioAssistantBot`).
5. Once your bot is created, BotFather will send you a **Token**. Save this token, as you will need it for your environment variables (e.g., `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`).
6. To get your chat ID:
   - Open your bot in Telegram and send it a message.
   - Visit the following URL in your browser, replacing `BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token:  
     `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
   - Look for the `chat` object in the response, which contains your **chat ID** (you can use this value for `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`).

## Fetching Blog from dev.to

To display your blog posts from dev.to on the portfolio:

1. Set your `devUsername` in the `utils/data.js` file to your dev.to username.
2. The application will automatically fetch your latest blog posts and display them in the **BLOG** section.
3. Ensure your blogs are publicly visible on dev.to, and the application will fetch them using the dev.to API.
