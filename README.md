# Tutorials :wrench:

## Gmail App Password Setup

1. **Log in to your Google Account** at [https://myaccount.google.com/](https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **Security** from the left sidebar.
3. Scroll down to the **"Signing in to Google"** section and make sure **2-Step Verification** is turned ON.
4. Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, you'll see an option for **App Passwords**.
5. Click on **App Passwords**. You may need to enter your Google account password again.
6. In the **Select app** dropdown, choose "Mail", and for **Select device**, choose "Other (Custom name)" and name it appropriately (e.g., "Portfolio").
7. Click **Generate**. A 16-character app password will be displayed. Save this password for later use in your environment variables (e.g., `GMAIL_PASSKEY`).

## Create a Telegram Bot

1. **Open Telegram** and search for the user **@BotFather**.
2. Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
3. Choose a name for your bot.
4. Set a unique username for your bot (must end with `bot`, e.g., `PortfolioAssistantBot`).
5. Once your bot is created, BotFather will send you a **Token**. Save this token, as you will need it for your environment variables (e.g., `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`).
6. To get your chat ID:
   - Open your bot in Telegram and send it a message.
   - Visit the following URL in your browser, replacing `BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token:  
     `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
   - Look for the `chat` object in the response, which contains your **chat ID** (you can use this value for `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`).
